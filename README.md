# Sparse_linear_regression
Project for optimization course

In this project we presented and implemented some new algorithms looking forward for a global minima search with hard sparsity constraints.
The difficulty of these kind of constraints is that even if the original problem is convex, the non-convex combinatorial structure of the feasible set makes them computationally hard.
Some numerical results on a Logistic regression benchmark are presented.
